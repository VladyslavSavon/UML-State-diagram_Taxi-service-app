# UML-State-diagram_Taxi-service-app
The UML State diagram of the taxi service app

## Short description of the diagram 

The UML state diagram is designed to describe the possible states of an object and the transitions between them. Together, they characterize the system's behavior throughout its entire lifecycle. The diagram represents the dynamic behavior of objects depending on events within the system.

This diagram illustrates the status changes an order goes through during a single cycle of the taxi service application.
